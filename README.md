# RAG++ — Production-Grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

RAG++ is a fully production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to mirror real-world search, recommendation, and question-answering infrastructure used in large-scale AI platforms.

The project prioritizes retrieval quality, ranking accuracy, latency stability, and system design clarity over prompt-heavy or demo-only abstractions.

## ✨ Key Features

### Hybrid Retrieval
- Semantic search using **FAISS** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
- Lexical search using **BM25**
- Fusion strategy combining semantic and keyword signals

### High-Precision Ranking
- Cross-encoder re-ranking for improved relevance
- Optimized candidate selection before generation

### Grounded LLM Answer Generation
- Instruction-tuned **FLAN-T5** for context-aware answers
- Answers generated strictly from retrieved documents

### Production API
- **FastAPI** service with structured request and response schema
- Warmup handling to reduce cold-start latency
- Query logging for observability

### Performance & Evaluation
- Recall@K benchmarking
- End-to-end latency measurement
- Stable sub-second responses on CPU

### Deployment-Ready
- Fully Dockerized
- No external API dependencies
- Reproducible local and container execution

## 🔌API Usage

### Search Endpoint

**POST** `/search`

### Request

```json

{
  "query": "iphone waterproof bluetooth speaker",
  "k": 5,
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "generate": true
}

```

### Response

```json

{
  "query": "iphone waterproof bluetooth speaker",
  "latency_ms": 520.3,
  "answer": "A good waterproof Bluetooth speaker option is the JBL Xtreme 2...",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 472,
      "text": "JBL Xtreme 2 Portable Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Blue",
      "hybrid_score": 0.029,
      "rerank_score": 4.86
    }
  ]
}

```

## Running Locally

```bash
python -m uvicorn service.app:app --reload
```

---

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker build -t rag-production-system .
docker run -p 8000:8000 rag-production-system
```

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project reflects real-world RAG system design by emphasizing:

- Retrieval correctness over prompt engineering

- Ranking quality before generation

- Latency stability and warmup handling

- Clear separation of retrieval, ranking, and generation

- Vendor-agnostic, open-source deployment

The architecture closely aligns with systems used in search, recommendation, and enterprise QA pipelines at large technology companies.
